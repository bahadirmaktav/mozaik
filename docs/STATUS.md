# V0.1 implementation and validation

Specification: local `.plans/TESSERA_V0.1_PLAN.md` (intentionally gitignored).

Work proceeds in the specification's order: foundation, layout model, interactions,
editor, data safety, packaging/validation. Platform results must be recorded from actual
runs; the existence of a config or test does not prove platform support.

## Platform checks still required

- Windows 10/11 WebView2: input/IME, clipboard, native picker/drop, Alt focus loss,
  crash recovery, independent windows and installer smoke.
- Hyprland and GNOME Wayland: the same checks, compositor modifier conflicts,
  GTK file dialogs and WebKitGTK rendering. No Linux session is available in this workspace.
- Measure startup, idle memory/CPU, resizing and large files on each target; no arbitrary
  performance acceptance threshold.
